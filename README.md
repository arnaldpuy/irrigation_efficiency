# Global irrigation water demands biased by unreliable irrigation efficiencies

This is the R code of the paper, whose abstract is the following: 

*A proper assessment of the human impact on the global water cycle requires estimating the volume of water withdrawn for irrigation agriculture. A key parameter in this calculation is the irrigation efficiency, which represents the fraction of water lost to the crop due to bad management or conveyance losses. Here we use sensitivity auditing and uncertainty/sensitivity analysis to show that the irrigation efficiency values used in global hydrological modelling are spuriously accurate.  They downplay important ambiguities in partial efficiencies, irrigation technologies, the definition of ``large-scale'' irrigated areas or managerial factors. If quantifiable uncertainties are accounted for, irrigation efficiencies turn from point-estimates to ranges spanning more than half the unit interval, making most countries largely undistinguishable. This uncertainty propagates to the computation of irrigation water withdrawals by making values vary by a factor of 3 and up to a factor of 20 at the country level. The irrigation module of global hydrological models should no longer overlook deep uncertainties if their estimates aim at informing irrigation and water-related policies in the real world.*
